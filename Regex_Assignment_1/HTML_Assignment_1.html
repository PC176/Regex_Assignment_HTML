        <h3>My Trip To California</h3>

        <p>It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for
           the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain.
           By the time we returned home, we had traveled some 1,300 miles in three and one
           half days.</p>

        <h3>My Trip To The Rockies</h3>

        <p>After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts.
            We flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Acadamy, Pike's Peak, Garden Of The Gods,
            and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in 
            Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded
            Amtrack's and rode the rails to Fingman, and then chartered a bus home.</p>

        <h3>My Trip To The Mid West</h3>

        <p>My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang sote 2,900 med to him in
           Indiana where he attends college. In noute, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illinois,and 
           Detroit, Michigan. We then bearded Amtrak in Chicago, and rode into Salt Lake City,
           where we boarded a bus  which returned us to Las Vegas</p>
